**Public Bike Sharing Ridership**
The analysis of public bike-sharing ridership data aims to uncover patterns in user behavior, identify peak usage times, and understand the factors that influence ridership. By examining detailed records of bike trips, including start and end times, stations, and user types, the goal is to derive insights that can help optimize bike-sharing services and improve urban mobility.
Key Findings:
Peak Usage Times: The data reveals clear peak periods during morning and evening commutes on weekdays, suggesting that bike-sharing is an integral part of the daily commute for many users.
Station Popularity: Central and transit-adjacent stations are the most popular, highlighting the importance of strategic station placement to maximize ridership.
User Behavior: Members are the primary users, likely due to subscription models that encourage regular use. Casual users, though fewer, tend to use bikes for longer trips, possibly for sightseeing or recreational purposes.
CONTENTS
1.Data Loading & Initial Exploration:
>Loads the dataset using pandas and prints the first few rows to understand its structure.
2.Data Cleaning:
>Converts start_time and end_time to datetime format.
>Adds new columns for day_of_week, hour_of_day, and trip_duration.
>Filters out trips with negative duration or those lasting more than 2 hours.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis:
>Ridership by Day of the Week: Uses countplot to visualize the number of trips taken on each day of the week.
>Ridership by Hour of the Day: Analyzes the distribution of trips by the hour to identify peak usage times.
>Popular Start Stations: Identifies the top 10 most popular start stations.
>Trip Duration Distribution: Visualizes the distribution of trip durations.
>User Type Distribution: Examines the distribution of different user types (e.g., members vs. casual users).
Technologies Used:
>Libraries: Use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for any advanced analysis like clustering.
>Visualization: Tools like Tableau, Power BI, or even Python-based visualization libraries can be used to create interactive dashboards or static visualizations.
